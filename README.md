# odin-recipes
An HTML website for showcasing the two main foods for breakfast and dinner in Venezuela and my favorite salad too.

This is my first project hope you like it.

One thing I've learned.
Beside learning html syntax, I think the most important thing I learned is the importance of good commits.

Cheers :)
