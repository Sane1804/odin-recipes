            <h4>How to make an empanada</h4>
            <p>But before moving on how to make an empanada let's explain what it is</p>
            <p>An empanada is a traditional food from venezuelan too, In this country there is a fight between both (Arepas vs Empanadas). In Venezuela most of people eat arepas if they are at home, but when you are at the street and hungry an empanada is the easiest food to find because everyone in there houses or stores sell it</p>
            <p>As well as arepas, empanadas have a lot of accompaniment</p>
